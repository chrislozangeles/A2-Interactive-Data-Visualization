<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

<p>

This report explores speculation-related housing dynamics in Boston by using
neighborhood-level trends in corporate ownership and owner occupancy (2004–2024),
and connecting them to housing structure signals (vacancy and housing units per capita)
and demographic composition (2024).

</p>


<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>

<ol>

<li>

<strong>
How have corporate ownership and owner occupancy changed over time across Boston neighborhoods (2004–2024)?
</strong>

Which neighborhoods diverge most from the citywide trend?

</li>


<li>

<strong>
Which neighborhoods look like “hotspots” of speculative dynamics?
</strong>

(High corporate ownership levels in 2024 and large increases since 2004),
and how do these relate to vacancy and housing units per capita?

</li>


<li>

<strong>
How does demographic composition correlate with corporate ownership in 2024?
</strong>

Are there visible patterns linking ownership structure with race/ethnicity shares
and college housing presence?

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>


<!-- Figure 1 -->

<strong>Histograms: Distribution of ownership and occupancy</strong>

These histograms show the distribution of corporate ownership and owner-occupancy rates across all neighborhoods and years in the dataset. Corporate ownership is skewed toward lower values but includes a long tail of high-ownership cases, indicating that while most neighborhoods have moderate levels, a subset has experienced substantial corporate acquisition. In contrast, owner occupancy is centered around higher percentages but shows a gradual shift downward over time. Together, these distributions suggest a structural transition in housing ownership patterns, with corporate ownership increasing while owner occupancy becomes less dominant.

<figcaption>

<strong>Corporate ownership evolution across neighborhoods (2004–2024 heatmap).</strong>

The heatmap reveals both temporal and spatial heterogeneity in ownership patterns.
Nearly all neighborhoods show gradual increases, but some areas such as South Boston
Waterfront, Fenway, and Longwood experience accelerated growth after approximately 2018.
This suggests a possible regime shift or intensification phase aligned with broader
housing market or financial trends.

<!-- Figure 3 -->

<figure>

<img src="img3.png"
     alt="Distribution and Boston average trends">

<figcaption>

<strong>Distribution and citywide trends.</strong>

Corporate ownership displays a right-skewed distribution, with most neighborhood-year
observations clustered at lower values but with an expanding high-ownership tail.
This suggests growing inequality across neighborhoods rather than uniform increases.
Citywide averages confirm a steady rise in corporate ownership accompanied by declining
owner occupancy.

<figcaption>

<strong>Corporate ownership current level vs long-term increase.</strong>

This quadrant analysis identifies distinct neighborhood categories. High-level and
rapid-growth areas emerge as speculative “hotspots,” while others show stability or
emerging trends. This classification helps prioritize areas for deeper structural
and demographic analysis.

     alt="Demographic composition sorted by ownership rate">

<figcaption>

<strong>Demographic composition relative to corporate ownership rate (2024).</strong>

Sorting neighborhoods by corporate ownership reveals variation in demographic composition
across the ownership spectrum. This visualization supports descriptive comparisons and
raises questions about structural housing dynamics and socioeconomic differences across
neighborhoods.

<figcaption>

<strong>Correlation heatmap of ownership, housing structure, and demographics (2024).</strong>

The correlation matrix summarizes relationships between ownership structure,
housing characteristics, and demographic variables. Strong negative relationships
between corporate ownership and owner occupancy reinforce the interpretation that
corporate investment contributes to structural ownership shifts.

<img src="img7.png"
     alt="Vacancy and housing units per capita">

<figcaption>

<strong>Housing structure indicators: vacancy and housing units per capita (2024).</strong>

These structural indicators provide context for speculative dynamics. Neighborhoods
with high vacancy and high housing units per capita may reflect investment-driven
ownership patterns rather than purely residential demand.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>

Between 2004 and 2024, corporate ownership increased substantially across Boston,
while owner occupancy declined. This trend was not uniform: certain neighborhoods
emerged as clear speculative hotspots characterized by both high ownership levels
and rapid growth.

Structural housing indicators and demographic composition provide additional context,
helping identify neighborhoods where speculative investment patterns may be most
visible. These findings motivate deeper investigation into underlying drivers and
policy implications.
