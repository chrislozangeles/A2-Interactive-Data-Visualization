      <h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

      <p>
        This report explores speculation-related housing dynamics in Boston by using neighborhood-level trends in
        corporate ownership and owner occupancy (2004–2024), and connecting them to housing structure signals
        (vacancy / housing units per capita) and demographic composition (2024).
      </p>

      <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>How have corporate ownership and owner occupancy changed over time across Boston neighborhoods (2004–2024)?</strong>
          Which neighborhoods diverge most from the citywide trend?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Which neighborhoods look like “hotspots” of speculative dynamics?</strong>
          (High corporate ownership levels in 2024 and large increases since 2004), and how do these relate to vacancy and housing units per capita?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How does demographic composition correlate with corporate ownership in 2024?</strong>
          Are there visible patterns linking ownership structure with race/ethnicity shares and college housing presence?
        </li>

          <strong>Figure 1 — Corporate ownership over time (selected years, top neighborhoods).</strong><br />
          This chart provides a quick “sanity check” snapshot of corporate ownership rates at several time points,
          showing how the top neighborhoods shift upward over time rather than staying flat. It helps compare
          neighborhoods side-by-side at key milestones (e.g., 2010, 2015, 2019, 2024) and highlights that the highest-ownership areas in 2024
          were already above-average earlier in the period.

          <strong>Figure 2 — Corporate ownership heatmap by neighborhood and year (2004–2024).</strong><br />
          The heatmap makes long-term change patterns easy to see: many neighborhoods move from low values in the mid-2000s
          toward noticeably higher levels after ~2018–2019. This view also reveals differences in timing—some neighborhoods
          ramp up earlier while others accelerate later—supporting follow-up questions about what may be driving those shifts.

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 3 — Overview of key rates: distributions + Boston averages over time.</strong><br />
          The distributions summarize the “shape” of the dataset and indicate heterogeneity: corporate ownership is right-skewed
          (many neighborhood-year records are low, with a long high-ownership tail), while owner occupancy spans a wider range.
          The citywide trend plot suggests corporate ownership rises substantially over time as owner occupancy declines, motivating deeper
          neighborhood-level analysis rather than relying only on averages.

          <strong>Figure 4 — Corporate ownership: current level (2024) vs increase since 2004.</strong><br />
          This quadrant view separates neighborhoods into interpretable groups: “hotspots” (high level + high change),
          “stable high” (high level + low change), “emerging” (low level + high change), and “stable low” (low level + low change).
          This is useful for prioritizing where speculation-like dynamics might be most visible, and it creates a structured way
          to compare housing structure and demographic differences across categories.

          <strong>Figure 5 — Demographic composition (2024) sorted by corporate ownership rate.</strong><br />
          Sorting neighborhoods by corporate ownership creates a clear visual comparison of how group shares vary across the ownership spectrum.
          This supports a descriptive (not causal) check of whether high corporate ownership areas differ systematically in racial/ethnic composition.
          The plot also motivates follow-ups: for example, whether these patterns persist after controlling for housing structure or student housing.

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 6 — Correlation heatmap (2024): ownership, housing structure, and demographics.</strong><br />
          The correlation matrix summarizes many pairwise relationships at once and helps identify which variables move together.
          It provides a fast way to spot strong negative/positive associations (e.g., corporate ownership vs owner occupancy),
          and it helps decide which relationships deserve more targeted scatterplots or neighborhood case studies.

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 7 — Housing structure signals (2024): vacancy vs housing units per capita.</strong><br />
          These two ranked bar charts provide interpretable “structural” context for speculation: vacancy can indicate unused or investment-held units,
          while housing units per capita approximates how housing stock compares to resident population. Viewing them side-by-side makes it easier to spot
          neighborhoods that simultaneously have high vacancy and high housing units per capita, which may align with speculative ownership patterns.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Across 2004–2024, corporate ownership increases substantially while owner occupancy declines, with strong variation by neighborhood.
        A small set of neighborhoods appear as “hotspots” with both high 2024 levels and large increases since 2004, motivating deeper investigation into
        local drivers and housing structure context. In 2024, demographic composition and structural housing signals provide additional lenses that help
        describe where speculation-like dynamics may be most visible and which neighborhoods to prioritize for follow-up analysis.
